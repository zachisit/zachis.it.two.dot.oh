		<div id="content_right"><h2>You Don't Have Time To Read This.</h2>You are busy. So busy, in fact, that you don't even have time to read this. You have work that needs to be done yesterday and you need to find a reliable, trustworthy developer amongst the sea of unseen faces on the web. Well, good news: your search is over! I have over a decade of freelancing experience as a web and mobile developer and through my experience, I've become a master in all the best and most popular frameworks for the web like WordPress, pure PHP, CakePHP, Larvel, Javascript, etc. and I develop mobile apps for both iOS and Android. I assure quality work in a timely manner because I'm interested in long-term business relationships. Not only will I build your website or application, I'll be around to keep up with maintenance and assure you're always ahead of the ball.
