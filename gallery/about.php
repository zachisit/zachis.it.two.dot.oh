		<h1>Looking For Your Web Consultant?</h1>		
		<center><img src="http://zachis.it/images/hd198x197.png"></center>
		Hello, my name is Zachary Smith, located in Louisville, Kentucky, in the EST timezone. I have extensive experience in frontend HTML/CSS/JavaScript projects, and I've worked exclusively with WordPress since its inception in 2003. I have strong exposure with PHP, and work on existing PHP websites or WordPress theme and WordPress plugin development on a daily basis. I've also taught myself Android and Apple app development, and continue to work on a few mobile proejcts each year.<br /><br />
		I've worked full time remotely for clients in the PHP and frontend space since high school, no breaks; and in 2010 <span class="zach-zach">zach</span><span class="zach-is">is.</span><span class="zach-it">it</span> was born. I am only interested in long term relationships, on projects that keep me excited and constantly learning more in the WordPress, PHP, OOP space. I never feel like this is a <i>"J-O-B"</i> because web development is a passion of mine and I love it every day.<br /><br />
		On a very personal note, in 2015 I was diagnosed and ultimately beat cancer. I feel blessed every day to be alive and doing what I love for amazing clients. Being able to pay the bills also helps keep me motivated.<br /><br />
